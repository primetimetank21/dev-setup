## Sprint 17 Decisions (2026-05-18+)

### Skill Formalization Wave -- worktree-remove-first + gh-pr-base-develop (Issues #383, #384)

**Date:** 2026-05-17  
**Author:** Pluto (Copilot, Sprint 17 Wave 1)  
**PR:** #386 (merged @ 17c940b)  

#### Skills formalized

**worktree-remove-first (update)**
- Confidence: medium (29+ applications across Sprints 12-16, lifecycle rules)
- Primary rationale: hygiene harvest (step 1) first, gh CLI quirk (step 4) second
- New citations: Sprint 15 PRs #357-360, Sprint 16 PRs #368-370

**gh-pr-base-develop (new)**
- Confidence: high (binary rule: flag either present or absent)
- Trigger: every gh pr create by squad agents
- Rule: always pass --base develop unless release cut (develop->main)
- Pre-flight: echo target base before gh pr create; verify with gh pr view <N> --json baseRefName after
- Recovery: git merge origin/main --no-ff --no-verify + chore(merge) type
- Citing: Sprint 16 PR #368 incident (Pluto-5 --base main mishap)

#### routing.md update

Added "Spawn-Prompt Hygiene" section. Coordinators must include --base develop snippet in every spawn that creates a PR.

#### Decision standing

Both skills now active team standards. Mandatory in every spawn prompt that invokes gh pr create. worktree-remove-first remains mandatory for all squad PR merge sequences.

### Sprint-End Label Automation with Verification-Retry Pattern (Issue #382)

**Date:** 2026-05-17  
**PR:** #389 (merged @ 400f9ac)  
**Author:** Donald (Copilot, Sprint 17 Wave 1)  

#### Delivery

Hybrid (script + workflow + SKILL):
- `scripts/sprint-end-labels.sh` -- runnable locally; --dry-run, --repo, --sprint, --release-label flags; idempotent via pre-fetched label-list keying
- `.github/workflows/sprint-end-labels.yml` -- workflow_dispatch with dry_run input (default true)
- `.squad/skills/gh-label-verify-retry/SKILL.md` -- write-then-verify pattern with retry backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) and reusable bash snippet
- `tests/test_sprint_end_labels.ps1` -- 6 tests, 2 exercise retry loop via function override

#### Verification approach

1. Pre-fetch candidate issues' labels in one gh issue list call
2. For each issue, drive has_label / verify_with_retry per operation
3. On mismatch, re-query only (not re-write) with exponential backoff
4. On final failure, print actual label set and exit 1

#### SKILL status

`gh-label-verify-retry` now formal SKILL (high confidence). Reusable for future label/state automations.

#### Follow-ups

- sprint:N labels not yet in use; retire release:backlog as de facto search key once adopted
- Consider workflow_run trigger on release PR merge if Mickey standardizes release workflow name
- squad-history-check workflow expects squad:donald PRs to modify .squad/agents/donald/history.md; #389 deferred append to follow-up per task spec

## 2026-05-17 Sprint 16 wrap (decisions fold)

### Sprint 16 EOS Audit Summary

**Conducted by:** Jiminy (Hygiene Auditor)  
**Date:** 2026-05-17T20:08:00-04:00  
**Verdict:** DIRTY (2 blockers resolved post-audit, 3 findings noted)

#### Blockers (resolved)

1. **Inbox drained** -- 4 files merged into decisions.md (this section)
2. **pluto/history.md compressed** -- reduced from 15694 B to under 15360 B hard gate

#### Findings (non-blocking)

1. **No Sprint 16 orchestration log entries** -- Only 1 entry exists (2026-05-17T19-20-00Z-mickey.md), documenting Sprint 15 dispatch. 8 Sprint 16 spawns have zero coverage. Scribe accepted gap.

2. **3 stale remote squad/* branches** -- origin/squad/367-skill-drift-audit, origin/squad/s16-retro, origin/squad/scribe-s16-history-append. Ralph cleanup pending.

3. **Squash-merge policy mismatch** -- Charter specifies "No squash merges on develop or main." Sprint 16 PRs #368, #369, #370, #372, #374, #375, #376 all squash-merged to develop. Only #373 (release merge) was correctly a regular merge. Follow-up: #371 should address this or charter needs update.

#### Audit passes

- Working tree: clean
- develop in sync: HEAD = origin/develop @ aba8332
- Tag 0.9.6: annotated tag 38c0942 -> commit 10d203f (correct)
- PR #373: regular merge (2 parents). Confirmed.
- 128218a on main: documented mistake, recovered via d102a7c forward-merge
- Issue #371: open, labels correct (type:chore, area:meta, squad:scribe, priority:p3)
- Open PRs: 0
- history.md timestamps: all 9 agents updated 2026-05-17
- All Sprint 16 commits on develop match manifest SHAs

#### Agent history.md sizes (HARD GATE 15360 B)

| Agent  | Bytes | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| chip   | 12446 | PASS   |
| doc    | 13420 | PASS   |
| donald | 12688 | PASS   |
| goofy  | 10925 | PASS   |
| jiminy | 12494 | PASS   |
| mickey | 11914 | PASS   |
| pluto  | <15360 | PASS (compressed) |
| ralph  | 13147 | PASS   |
| scribe | 13729 | PASS   |

### Sprint 16 Issue Dispatch

**Conducted by:** Mickey (Triage Lead)  
**Issues filed:** 6

1. **#363** -- Scribe: decisions.md archival (decisions.md 60270 B -> 51200 B hard gate)
2. **#362** -- Pluto: ascii-docs-about-non-ascii SKILL.md (prevents self-documenting pitfall)
3. **#364** -- Pluto: worktree-base-refresh SKILL.md (recovery recipe for branch ancestry bleed)
4. **#367** -- Pluto: skill drift watchlist audit (confidence freshness check)
5. **#366** -- Pluto: skill graduation audit (promote low->medium, medium->high per thresholds)
6. **#365** -- Mickey: tag prefix sanity check (verify X.Y.Z bare convention)

**Wave A (parallel):** #363, #362, #364, #365
- #363: Scribe direct-push (develop, --no-verify)
- #362, #364: Pluto skills (disjoint paths, parallel-safe)
- #365: Mickey comment-only (no repo writes)

**Wave B (serialized after Wave A):** #367, then #366
- #367: drift audit, reads-only, writes pluto-skill-drift-2026-05-17.md
- #366: graduation audit, reads #367 findings, writes to SKILL.md

Charter alignment: No conflicts identified. Scribe direct-push pattern matches Sprint 15 workflow.

### Sprint 16 Work Completion

**Issues closed:** 6

1. **#362 (PR #369)** -- ascii-docs-about-non-ascii/SKILL.md -- medium confidence, 2 observations (Sprint 14 #340, Sprint 15 #356/#359)

2. **#363 (direct push 5f07514)** -- decisions.md archival pass -- 1 stale 2025-07-14 entry moved to decisions-archive.md. Hard gate (51200 B) not met mid-sprint; follow-up #371 filed for policy review.

3. **#364 (PR #370)** -- worktree-base-refresh/SKILL.md -- low confidence, 1 observation (Sprint 15 #359)

4. **#365 (comment-close)** -- Tag prefix sanity check -- 14/14 tags conform to bare X.Y.Z convention. No drift.

5. **#366 (comment-close)** -- Skill graduation audit -- 0 candidates eligible. Closed as no-op per #367 findings.

6. **#367 (PR #368)** -- Skill drift watchlist audit -- 30 skills audited, 0 graduation candidates, 27 with zero observed applications, 3 low-confidence under threshold. Report at pluto-skill-drift-2026-05-17.md.

### Forward-Merge Recovery Context

PR #368 (skill drift audit) landed on main by mistake at commit 128218a. Forward-merged back to develop via merge commit d102a7c. main was an ancestor of develop at release time; the develop->main PR #373 brought main forward via regular merge.

### Release SHAs (0.9.6)

- Squash commit (develop, PR #372): 7172ae7f31e6c3a0099313c198558db122186439
- Merge commit (main, PR #373): 10d203fd023077ec3526d8b1bdc17defadd2ace4
- Tag 0.9.6: 38c0942f1959299cfccd084710da90379ff46d59
- GitHub release: https://github.com/primetimetank21/dev-setup/releases/tag/0.9.6

### decisions.md Archival Pass

**Issue:** #363  
**Scope:** decisions.md exceeded hard gate (51200 bytes); archival per 2026-05-10 cutoff rule  
**Cutoff date:** 2026-05-10 (7 days before 2026-05-17)  
**Criterion:** Entries dated 2026-05-09 or earlier

**Entries moved:** 1 (2025-07-14 -- Gitconfig editor literal value + override comment, Issue #184, 1153 bytes)

**File sizes after archival:**

| File | Before | After | Change |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| decisions.md | 60270 B | 59116 B | -1154 B |
| decisions-archive.md | 121949 B | 123171 B | +1222 B |

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [x] Entry count: 6 + 9 (combined)
- [x] No entries lost in transit
- [ ] decisions.md < 51200 bytes: FAIL (59116 B, 7916 B over gate)
- [x] ASCII-only in additions: 0 non-ASCII bytes
- [x] Header marker updated: "2026-05-04 fold" -> "2026-05-09 second fold"

**Note:** Hard gate not met. Only 1 entry before cutoff date 2026-05-10. Earliest remaining live entry is 2026-05-14 (5 days after cutoff). No entries exist in 2026-05-05 through 2026-05-13 range. Follow-up #371 filed for policy review.

### Decision

Accept all Sprint 16 work as complete. Acknowledge decisions.md gate breach (#371 tracks policy review). Scribe compression of pluto/history.md resolves blocker #2.

## 2026-05-17T20:30 Earl directive -- squash-merge policy clarification

**By:** Earl (via Coordinator, Sprint 16 EOS Q&A)
**What:** Squash merges to `develop` ARE the standing policy. Regular merges apply ONLY to `develop -> main` release cuts (and any back-merge recovery). Jiminy's charter line 41 ("No squash merges on develop or main") was outdated -- update to clarify.
**Why:** Sprint 16 squash-merge mismatch surfaced by Jiminy-4 EOS audit. Earl confirmed via choice "Charter is outdated -- squash to develop is what I want."
**Impact:**
- Jiminy charter line 41 needs rewrite
- No retroactive changes to past sprints (no history rewriting)
- This memory should be stored for future sessions
